### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

## ğŸ‘¥ | Who I am
I'm based in Germany. I want to learn more about the development of modern software. My journey started 3 years ago with JavaScript and the development of websites.
Soon I found CSS Frameworks like Bootstrap and began to use it. 
I'm not very familiar with Node.js and the backend. I've already installed Node.js, but I mainly use the NPM package manager.

## ğŸ¦¾ | My Intention
I want to make everyone's lives easier and better with the software I create.

ğŸ“œ | other
I've already created some nice projects. Take a look and try it out. If you want, give me a quick feedback.
