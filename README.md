### Hi there 👋

## 👥 | Who I am
I'm based in Germany. I want to learn more about the development of modern software. My journey started 3 years ago with JavaScript and the development of websites.
Soon I found CSS Frameworks like Bootstrap and began to use it. 
I'm not very familiar with Node.js and the backend. I've already installed Node.js, but I mainly use the NPM package manager.

## 🎲 | My Intention
I want to make everyone's lives easier and better with the software I create.

# 🦾 | My Skills
 - I have a basic knowledge of git and powershell. I am also familiar with the Boostrap Framework. 
 - Basic Knowledge of JavaScript
 - Basic Knowledge of CSS and HTML
